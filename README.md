# VueVault

Welcome to VueVault - your one-stop destination for exploring the fascinating world of movies! ðŸŽ¥ Powered by Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, this dynamic web application makes discovering movies a breeze.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have these tools ready:

- A keen sense of adventure (and some familiarity with command line interfaces, CLI)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), the backbone of our JavaScript journey
- A text editor or IDE, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), to weave your magic
- JavaScript, enabled and ready in your web browser

## Installation Guide

Let's get VueVault up and running on your local machine:

### Step 1: Node.js and npm

First, the basics:
- Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Verify the installation with a quick `node -v` and `npm -v` in your CLI.

### Step 2: The Magic of Vue.js and Vite

No need to install these separately, as they magically appear during our next step!

### Step 3: Cloning the Repository

Time to get your own copy of VueVault:
- Open your CLI.
- Navigate to your desired folder.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/paolacernada/vuevault.git`.
- Switch to the project directory: `cd VueVault`.

### Step 4: Dependency Party

Let's invite all our dependencies:
- Run `npm install`.

### Step 5: Tailwind CSS (Only if You're Fancy)

If Tailwind CSS is playing hide and seek (missing `tailwind.config.js`):
- Run `npm install tailwindcss`.
- Then, `npx tailwindcss init`.

### Step 6: Spill the Secrets (Environment Variables)

Create or edit a `.env` file in the project root. Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and any other secret spells.

### Step 7: Ignition (Start the Development Server)

Fire up VueVault with:
- `npm run dev`.

### Step 8: VueVault in Action

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and witness the magic!

### Step 9: Exploration Time

Now, wander around VueVault. Check out those movie searches and details modals!

## Additional Setup

For a smoother journey:

## Troubleshooting

If you hit a roadblock:
